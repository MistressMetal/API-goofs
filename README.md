### Pokemon
A simple oroject made for a friend who plays Pokemon Go. I do not entirely know what 'raid exclusive' means, but I was assured this is helpful.

- checks the raid exclusive Pokemon once a day
- if there has been a change since the last check, text the given phone #:
    - the current raid exclusive pokemon and their raud level
    - which of those pokemon are newly raid exclusive
    - any pokemon that are no longer raid exclusive
    

### Spotidada
This is a work in progress.

The program creates three pkaylists based on the third word* of the leading CNN.com story at the time.  Each playlist contains ten songs,all with that word in the title. Using the determinations made by Spotify, the playlists are:

-ten most popular songs
-ten shortest songs, that are at least 30sec
-5 most dancable, and five least dancable songs

This has been conceptualized as a dadaist art piece. up
